Moodle is primarily designed as a Learning Management System (LMS) for managing courses and learning activities. You can use custom fields, user roles, and communication tools to create a system where you can associate students with their parents.

Usage
Here's a general guide:
1. Create Custom Fields for Student and Parent Information:
•	Go to "Site administration" > "Users" > "Accounts" > "Profile fields."
•	Add custom fields for student information and parent information.
•	For example, you might add fields like "Parent Name," "Parent Email," etc.
•	For parent information to be displayed on the student’s profile, students must fill the parent’s custom field and vice versa for the students information to be displayed on parent’s profile
2. Enroll Parents in Relevant Courses:
•	Enroll parents in courses where they need access to information or resources.
•	Use the "Enrol users" option in the course settings.
3. Custom Enrolment Fields (Optional):
•	If you need specific information during enrolment (e.g., relationship to student), customize enrolment fields.
•	Go to "Site administration" > "Users" > "Accounts" > "User profile fields."
4. Use Messaging and Communication Tools:
•	Utilize Moodle's messaging and communication tools for communication between students, parents, and teachers.
•	Encourage parents to update their contact information in their profiles.
5. Forums and Announcements:
•	Create forums or use the Announcements feature for sharing important information.
•	Parents and students can be enrolled in the same courses or groups.
6. Conditional Activities:
•	Use conditional activities to restrict access based on specific conditions.
•	For example, you might have resources that are visible only to parents.
7. Feedback and Surveys:
•	Use surveys or feedback activities to collect information from parents about their experience.
•	You can create a feedback activity in Moodle.
8. Reports and Analytics:
•	Use Moodle's reporting tools to gather analytics on student and parent activities.
•	Review participation reports to understand engagement.
9. External Systems Integration (Optional):
•	If your institution uses external systems, consider integrations to synchronize student and parent information.
•	Some Student Information Systems (SIS) have integrations with Moodle.
10. User Import (Optional):
•	If you have a large number of students and parents, you can use the "Upload users" feature to import them in bulk.
•	Prepare a CSV file with the necessary details.
Important Notes:
•	Always respect privacy and data protection regulations when handling student and parent information.
•	Communicate clearly with users about the purposes for which their information is collected.
•	Regularly review and update profiles and user data based on changing needs.

Assigning the parent to the student
•	Access the child's full profile page, via Site administration ► Users ► Accounts ► Browse list of users
•	Click the child's name to view the profile.
•	In the Administration section, click Preferences
•	In the Roles section, click Assign roles relative to this user
•	Choose the role to assign i.e. Parent by clicking on the word.
•	Select the parent in the potential users list and use the Add button to add it to the existing users list.
At this point you can return to the "Assign roles in user:" page and you should see that the parent name is now in the "Users with Role" column.
NOTE:The same parent may be assigned to several students, siblings or otherwise.
Agreeing to policies on behalf of the child
If the parent has been given the Capabilities/tool/policy:acceptbehalf then they can click on the child's profile, click the Policies and agreements link and agree to the policies there.
