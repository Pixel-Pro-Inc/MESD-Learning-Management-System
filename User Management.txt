Add/Edit Staff
1. Created a Dummy account and assigned role 'Student' to it. Username: dummy, password: Dummy2023*
2. As site admin I'm able to edit Dummy's profile. Added raspberry to Dummy's description and updated the profile
3. Guest accounts are unable to add/edit staff because they have no admin privileges.
4. Course "TEMP" had to be created to ensure allow teachers and student roles to be assigned
Student accounts are also unable to add accounts. Dummy's a student now
Delete Dummy and delete the courses when you're done with review
